# Orez : Prototype Rice Disease Detection System
A mobile application using Flutter designed for Pixel 2 device.

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>As part of our submission to UM Hackathon 2021, we have trained a CustomVision model in Microsoft Azure and exported it into TensorFlow Lite. 
I am tasked to create a graphical user interface on mobile application for the deep learning model to predict and label images given by the user.
</p>

<h1><u>Features</u></h1>

<h2>â€¢ Intuitive and Innovative Display of Paddy Crops</h2>

<p>Our simple grid layout makes it easy and intuitive for users to navigate our app.

ðŸŸ¢ = Healthy
ðŸ”´ = Sick

Prototype is supposed to receive video input from drone, but since we do not have the available funds, we have used a picture of a Paddy image from the validation dataset that the model has not seen yet for each square Paddy object, and predicted the output based on our own trained learning model.

<h2>â€¢ Uses Artificial Intelligence to Predict Rise Disease</h2>

<p>
We trained a deep-learning model in Azure using the dataset given ![here](https://www.kaggle.com/minhhuy2810/rice-diseases-image-dataset) .
</p>

<h2>â€¢ Access Gallery for Image Input</h2>

<p>
Gallery or Google Drive is accessible to use for input.
